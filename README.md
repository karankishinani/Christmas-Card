# Christmas-Card
Christmas Card Project built using Turbo C/C++

## Note:
```
1. The main program is “CONSOLA.C”
2. This program is designed to execute using Borland Turbo C/C++ in the DOS enviornment.
```

## Objective
To apply the concepts on interruptions and pointers in the develpment of solutions under the C programming language in low level.

## Description
This is a program that presents a screen with a Christmas graphic card. This graphic is built pixel by pixel (in low level). In addition, the mouse buttons were implemented: right click triggers a Christmas music (function with the melody programmed at low level in C) and left click stops it. Double clicking on the graphic activates a special effect function.

The screen also shows an arrow that when dragged with the mouse to the right end of the screen executes a function that generates snowfall on the card, step by step in a random but linear way from top to bottom, when the arrow is dragged to its original position the snow ceases. In the last line a message appears to press any key to continue, when this happens another window with message and background of Christmas color will appear, the message is stored word by word in an array manipulated with pointers and dynamic allocation of memory, and the user can change the original message, if desired. The program handles functions built at low level.
